| 4Ô∏è‚É£ Initialize repository | `git init`                                         | Turns the current folder into a Git repository (creates a hidden `.git` folder).                         |

Bonus Practice Tips

Try these mini-drills for practice:

After editing a file ‚Üí git status, git add ., git commit -m "Updated file", git push

Run git log --oneline to see a compact list of commits.

Run git help <command> for built-in explanations (e.g. git help commit).

üß≠ Lesson 2 Summary ‚Äî Branching & Merging in Git
#	Command	Meaning	Description
1	git branch	view branches	Lists all branches in your repo. The active one has a * next to it.
2	git branch <branch-name>	create branch	Makes a new branch but doesn‚Äôt switch to it.
3	git checkout <branch-name>	switch branch	Moves you to another branch.
4	git checkout -b <branch-name>	create & switch	Shortcut to create and immediately switch to a new branch.
5	git add <file>	stage file	Prepares the file to be committed (tracked for next snapshot).
6	git commit -m "message"	save snapshot	Saves staged changes with a description message.
7	git merge <branch-name>	merge branch	Combines changes from the specified branch into the current one.
8	git branch -d <branch-name>	delete branch	Safely deletes a branch that has already been merged.
9	git log --oneline --graph --all	view history graph	Displays all commits and branches in a visual tree.
10	git pull origin main	sync from GitHub	Downloads (fetch + merge) updates from your GitHub repository.
üí° Concepts You Mastered

A branch is a separate workspace for experimenting safely.

Merging integrates changes into the main project.

Deleting branches keeps your repo clean after merging.

Pulling syncs your local files with GitHub‚Äôs remote version.
