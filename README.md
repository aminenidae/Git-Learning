Bonus Practice Tips

Try these mini-drills for practice:

After editing a file ‚Üí git status, git add ., git commit -m "Updated file", git push

Run git log --oneline to see a compact list of commits.

Run git help <command> for built-in explanations (e.g. git help commit).

üß≠ Lesson 2 ‚Äî Branching & Merging

|  #  | Command                           | Meaning            | Description                                                                |
| :-: | --------------------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  1  | `git branch`                      | View branches      | Lists all branches in your repository. The active one has a `*` beside it. |
|  2  | `git branch <branch-name>`        | Create branch      | Creates a new branch (does not switch to it).                              |
|  3  | `git checkout <branch-name>`      | Switch branch      | Moves you to another existing branch.                                      |
|  4  | `git checkout -b <branch-name>`   | Create & switch    | Creates **and** switches to a new branch in one step.                      |
|  5  | `git add <file>`                  | Stage file         | Adds a file‚Äôs changes to the staging area (preparing it for commit).       |
|  6  | `git commit -m "message"`         | Save snapshot      | Saves staged changes as a commit with a message.                           |
|  7  | `git merge <branch-name>`         | Merge branch       | Combines another branch‚Äôs changes into the current one.                    |
|  8  | `git branch -d <branch-name>`     | Delete branch      | Deletes a branch that has already been merged.                             |
|  9  | `git log --oneline --graph --all` | View history graph | Shows commits and branch structure visually.                               |
|  10 | `git pull origin main`            | Sync from GitHub   | Fetches and merges the latest changes from the remote repo.                |

üí° Concepts You Mastered

A branch lets you experiment safely without touching main.

Merging brings those changes back into the main line of development.

Deleting branches keeps your workspace tidy.

Pulling keeps your local copy in sync with GitHub.
